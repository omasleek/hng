            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>As I progress through this program, I'm realizing that web development is as much about problem-solving and creativity as it is about technical skills. Each project teaches me something new about user experience, accessibility, and the importance of writing maintainable code.</p>
            <p>I'm particularly drawn to the intersection of technology and human-centered design. Creating interfaces that are intuitive and accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or devices, feels like a meaningful contribution to the digital world.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie in emerging technologies like Web Components, Progressive Web Apps, and the continued evolution of JavaScript frameworks. The web development community is vibrant and supportive, and I'm grateful to be part of it.</p>
